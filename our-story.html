                        Our name, VIVANT, reflects our commitment to great tasting wines and our responsibility to the environment. Great wine starts in the vineyard. No pesticides. No herbicides. Minimal intervention. So the grape can express its full potential and the place where it’s grown. Today, less than 3% of the world’s wines are produced by these principles. The good news: this number is growing.

No additives in the winemaking process. Complete traceability of the grapes, the winemaking and the aging process. And a commitment to workplace equality and diversity. Together, we’re building a sustainable future for wine.

                        <p>VIVANT was born at Château de Pommard, the 300-year-old storybook domain in Burgundy. Curious by nature, we embarked on a biodynamic viticulture journey several years ago and have seen our wines become more aromatic, flavorful and energetic. In this small village of 518 inhabitants, we started thinking about how to share our discoveries.</p>
                        <p>The goal is to recreate the magic of our wine experiences without the carbon footprint of stepping on an airplane. We brought together an international team of wine educators, product designers, software engineers and media producers to create immersive Live Experiences. Now you can meet responsible winemakers around the world and taste their wines wherever you are.</p>
